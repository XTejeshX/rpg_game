# player.py - Phase 4: Player as a Class
#
# WHAT CHANGED FROM PHASE 3?
#   Before : player was a plain dict  → player["hp"], player["attack"]
#   Now    : player is an object      → player.hp,    player.attack
#
# WHY IS THIS BETTER?
#   - Data (hp, gold) and behaviour (heal, level_up) live TOGETHER in one place
#   - You can't accidentally pass the wrong thing — a Player is always a Player
#   - Easy to serialize to JSON and recreate from JSON (to_dict / from_dict)
